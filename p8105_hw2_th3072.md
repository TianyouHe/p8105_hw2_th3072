# Problem 1

## part 1 `clean the data in pols-month.csv`

``` r

## part 2 `clean the data in snp.csv`

``` r

## part 3 `tidy the unemployment data`

``` r

  rename(year = Year)|>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",

## part 4 `merge data`

``` r
merged_data <- pols|> 
  left_join(snp, by = c("year","month"))|>
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

*brief description*

For `pols` dataset, there are 822 observation and the key variable here
should be `president`, showing that `dem` or `gop`. The other variable
also classified by `dem` and `gop`. The time for this dataset is from
1947 to 2015.

For `snp` dataset, there are 787 observation and the key variable here
should be `close`. The time for this dataset is from 1950 to 2015.

For `unemployment` dataset, there are 816 observation and the key
variable here should be `unemployment rate`. The time for this dataset
is from 1948 to 2015.

*brief description*

There are four dataset here: `mr_trash_wheel`, `professor_trash_wheel`,
`Gwynnda_trash_wheel`, and `all_data`. 584 observation for
mr_trash_whell, 106 observation for professor_trash_wheel,and 156
observation for Gwynnda_trash_wheel.

For `all_data`, there are 846 observation and key variables for these
four datasets are `weight` and `home_powered`.

The total weight of trash collected by `professor_trash_wheel` here is
216.26 and the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}.

## amyloid data

```

``` r

write_csv(combined, "./hw2_data/ combined baseline and amyloid.csv") # save document
```

*brief discription *

There are 479 participant were recruited, and of these, there are 93
people develop the MCI.

The average baseline age is 65.0286013.

The proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers is 0.3.

Moreover, number people only in baseline but not in amyloid are 8 and
number only in amyloid but not in baseline 16. After combining these two
data, there are 471 people in both baseline and amyloid dataset. This
shows that there is a strong relationship between baseline and amyloid.
